## Repository Structure
This repository contains data collected from the accelerometers in the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The raw data
is no longer found in this location. It can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 
The changes I have made are in the top-level folder.

### Processed Data
At the top-level, there are the files that show how I changed the data. "CodeBook.md" describes both my final
results and how I got there. "run_analysis.r" is the script that provides the results. "TidyDataSet.csv" is the 
file containing the actual results.
